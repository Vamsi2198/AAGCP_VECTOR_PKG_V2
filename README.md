# AAGCP-Vector

**PII governance for vector databases — the AAGCP six-phase control plane,
ported from structured data to embedding space.**

Answers one question, completely:

> *"Our documents contain PII. Once they're embedded in a vector database,
> how do we mask it?"*

## The answer in three sentences

You cannot mask a vector after embedding — the PII is mathematically
distributed across every dimension. So AAGCP moves enforcement to
ingestion: PII is detected and replaced with deterministic vault tokens
*before* embedding, role policy decides what gets rehydrated at query
time, and GDPR erasure becomes a vault-key deletion (crypto-shred) that
instantly anonymizes every vector referencing the subject — with zero
re-embedding and zero vector operations.

## Run it

```bash
python demo.py        # numpy + pyyaml only; no network, no API keys
```

Five acts: the ungoverned leak baseline → six-phase governed ingestion →
one query under three roles → GDPR crypto-shred → metrics + tamper-evident
audit verification. A full run report lands in `demo_output/run_report.md`.

## Lineage: one control plane, two substrates

| | AAGCP (existing) | AAGCP-Vector (this repo) |
|---|---|---|
| Substrate | Snowflake columns | Embedding pipelines |
| Enforcement point | `CREATE MASKING POLICY` | Pre-embedding tokenization |
| Role gating | `CURRENT_ROLE()` CASE | Query-time rehydration policy |
| Erasure | `DELETE` / `UPDATE` | Crypto-shred (vault key deletion) |
| Audit | SQLite audit log | Hash-chained JSONL (WORM-style) |
| Loop | Observe→…→Learn | Identical six phases |

## What's demo-grade vs production (read this, it's honest)

| Component | Demo | Production path |
|---|---|---|
| PII detection | Regex + lexicon (Indian PII first-class) | Presidio / NER adapter — same interface as AAGCP's existing `PIIAnalyzer` fallback chain |
| Embeddings | Feature-hashing (numpy, deterministic) | `EmbedderAdapter` → sentence-transformers / OpenAI / provider-native |
| Vector store | In-memory cosine | `VectorStoreAdapter` → Endee/Pinecone/Qdrant (~30 lines each) |
| Vault | JSON + HMAC tokens; shred = mapping deletion | Per-subject envelope encryption, shred the key not the row; HSM-backed secret; Postgres/KMS |
| Subject attribution | "Patient <name>" anchor heuristic | Entity-resolution model + human review queue |
| Policy | Single YAML | Versioned policy store with conflict resolution + approval workflow (already designed in AAGCP) |

Known limitations worth saying out loud: token substitution shifts the
embedding (cosine ≈ 0.74 raw↔masked in the demo) — acceptable because
*all* corpus documents are tokenized identically, so relative rankings
hold; semantic-inference leakage ("the diabetic patient in ward 3") is
not addressed by tokenization and needs the session-level behavioral
layer on the roadmap; deterministic tokens trade unlinkability for
retrieval quality by design — frequency analysis of tokens is possible,
which is why the vault secret matters.

## Roadmap (sequenced, not aspirational)

1. Endee adapter + real embedder benchmarks (retrieval-quality deltas)
2. Chunk-level Merkle provenance for surgical staleness re-embedding
3. Session-level behavioral governance (mosaic-attack detection)
4. Agent-generated vector governance — memory written by agents has no
   source document; provenance unit becomes the agent session
